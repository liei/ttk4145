I am interested in attempting to provide basic maintainence to this library.
It seems to have been sitting around for 15 years or so without recieving much
care. Supposedly, it is useful for a program known as ferret (
http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret ). I was able to fix up the header file
a bit and add this autotools buildsystem. I am willing to host a Mercurial
repository and review and apply patches if people put thought into them and
submit them.

My motivation is ``distren'', a personal project, for which I would like to utilize
a generic linked-list library. I am somewhat against reinventing the wheel ;-).

Thus, I bring forth liblist-2.2 (see ChangeLog)
