This directory provides a generic cache package built upon the list(3)
library.  It is an example of a list(3) library application that goes
beyond the simple header-file implemented queue and stack examples
described previously.

The package here implements a cache as a linked list, with lookups
optimized for MRU (Most Recently Used) and LRU replacement.  The size
of the cache, as a number of elements, is determined by the user at cache
creation.

The user supplies his/her matching function that is used for checking
the cache.  In addition, the user may have the package deal with data
storage allocation, or may do so themselves.  A hook for specifying
a deallocation procedure is also provided.

See the man page for more information.

This package is constrained by the GNU General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation.  See the file COPYING for details.

Enjoy.
