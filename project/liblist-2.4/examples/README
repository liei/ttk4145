This directory contains example programs that make use of the list package.

In this directory are three programs, one to illustrate the list package
itself, and two other programs that make use of the queue and stack
header files that in turn use the list package.  The latter two programs
illustrate a traditional queue and stack in terms of the list primitives,
although this is hidden from the programmer.  The mapping of queue and
stack primitives to list primitives is accomplished by a single header
file each, makeing use of direct functional mappings to list primitives.

Finally, the cache directory provides a generic cache package that is
also built on the list package.  It serves to illustrate further use
of the list generality.  See the README there for more information.

This package is constrained by the GNU General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation.  See the file COPYING for details.

Enjoy.
