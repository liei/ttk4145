	* liblist-2.4:
	- Use size_t instead of int for referring to memory lengths.
	- Doxygen-style documentation and more self-documenting variable names.
	- Support building DLLs for mingw32 target.
	- Add convenience list_remove_element() to remove an element identified by its pointer.
	- Use list_status_t (an enum) instead of #define for LIST_EXTENT, LIST_OK, and LIST_EMPTY.
	- Update cache example to use the preferred cache_t instead of CACHE *.
	- Rename manpages llist(3) -> liblist(3), lqueue(3) -> liblist_queue(3), lstack(3) -> liblist_stack(3) and add manpage .so pointers for each documented function and header.
	- Use lstack_t instead of stack_t to avoid typedef conflicts with Darwin's libc.
	- Fix handling malloc() returning NULL (one potential segfault and another potential memory leak); thanks to Vincent LE GARREC <legarrec.vincent@gmail.com> for the patch.

	* liblist-2.3.1:
	- #defines to prevent symbol collions such as with libmysqlclient.so ( http://bugs.mysql.com/52725 )
	- API now uses typedefs instead of macros for types
	- a very basic testsuite
	- release 2.3 isn't distributed because it was a dud without the shared object ABI version bump or these changelogs

	* liblist-2.2:
	- Modernized function prototypes in the four manpages, header files, and source files.

	- #ifndef #define #endif wrapper for public header files.
	- Disable macro implementations of functions.
