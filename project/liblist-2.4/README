Version 2.3
29 May 2010	Nathan Phillip Brink	ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net

API now uses typedefs instead of macros for its types. There is also a small
testsuite which tests very basic functionality of liblist. Also, #defines
were introduced which break binary compatibility but prevent random symbol
collisions ( http://bugs.mysql.com/52725 ).

Version 2.2
26 December 2009	Nathan Phillip Brink	ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net

http://ohnopub.net/liblist

See NEWS. A publicly-accessible Mercurial repository is available at
http://ohnopub.net/hg/liblist-unbased . Hopefully, I will someday be
able to extract the revisions from nerdboy's SVN repo. If that happens,
the new repository URL will be http://ohnopub.net/hg/liblist.

Imported into local repo for mirroring Gentoo package; this is a required
dependency of Ferret (see http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/home).

Updated makefiles to remove old paths and accommodate CFLAGS.

This package provides generic linked-list manipulation routines.

In addition, queue and stack abstractions are provided by single header files.
To use the package as a list, queue, or stack, simply include the respective
header file and compile with the list library.  Thus, a single set of linked
list primitives can be used to implement stacks, queues, or any other
list-based data structure (such as caches, etc.).

The paper directory contains LaTeX source and DVI and Postscript output from
a paper entitled "The list(3) Package: Software Design and Reusability",
that describes the design and evolution of the package.  This paper appears
in the proceedings of the ACM 30th Annual Southeast Conference, Raleigh,
North Carolina, April 8-10, 1992.

The man page and install targets in the Makefile assume the library, man
pages, and header files will be installed as a piece of system software.
Specifically, the man pages refer to the header file with <>'s instead of
quotes, and the library is referred to with the -l compiler switch.

A set of example programs are provided to illustrate the package.  They
can be compiled without installing (see above) the library.

By default, some of the routines are implemented as macros.  You can
override this by commenting out the -DUSE_MACROS from the Makefile and
recompiling.  Note that this #define also updates the man pages.
 --edit by ohnobinki: USE_MACROS has been weeded out of this package

I have tested this package on Sun3, Sun4, DecStation 5000, PC/RT, HP
9000-400, and Sony(68030, News 3.3) architectures, and it performs
well.  Please notify me of bug reports, comments, or suggestions.

This package is constrained by the GNU General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation.  See the file COPYING for details.

Enjoy.
